*The Water-Lily Pond (1899) — Claude Monet*

## Opening Thoughts

this year taught me a lot.
and yeah, it **definitely** was my year.

not because everything worked.
and definitely not because i won all the time.
but because i kept showing up even when things were unclear, unfinished, or uncomfortable.

this was not a "victory lap."
it was a mere *checkpoint* in my life.

## Before the Wins

i started 2025 restless.

i wanted momentum. proof. something *concrete* to point at.
i thought output would fix the noise in my head.

sometimes it did. sometimes it didn't.

what this year gave me was contrast.
building vs feeling.
shipping vs sitting with things i kept avoiding.

here's what actually happened:

## The Timeline

### January

- built + launched [portify](https://github.com/ArjunCodess/portify) on [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/portify-2/launches/getportify)

i opened the year building. that pattern never really stopped.

### February

- built typethelyrics. launched on [peerlist](https://peerlist.io/arjuncodess/project/typethelyrics)
- built + launched book quote generator on [peerlist](https://peerlist.io/arjuncodess/project/book-quote-generator)

fast builds. fast launches. chasing feedback.

### March

- built and deployed [flashreels](https://github.com/ArjunCodess/FlashReels)

big project, covering the whole month.

### April

- built [nirvana.ai](https://github.com/mdkaifansari04/nirwana-ai) with friends for a [hackathon (HACKHAZARDS '25)](https://devfolio.co/projects/nirvanaai-4093)

![nirvana.ai project showcase](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p7Z1iQxfE589wJvAMM0cgw.png)

- top 100 submissions out of thousands

first reminder that scale exists beyond my bubble.

### May

- built and launched [woo-next](git.new/woo-next) on [peerlist](https://peerlist.io/arjuncodess/project/woonext)
- built [chemistrycheck](https://github.com/ArjunCodess/chemistrycheck)
- wrote my best writing piece till date: [13th May 2025](https://arjunwritess.medium.com/13th-may-2025-a580d8a54304)
- [structura.ai](https://github.com/ArjunCodess/structura) was staff picked project of the day on [peerlist](https://peerlist.io/arjuncodess/project/structuraai)

![structura.ai project](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*c7PCB27gRBlU0j5l)

may was loud. too loud.
a lot landed. a lot broke internally.

### June

- participated in the [storyblok challenge](https://dev.to/arjuncodess/introducing-the-storyblok-mcp-server-1cdd) by dev.to. didn't win
- rejected a 30k/month + equity offer from a guy
- started building [pilot ops](https://pilot-ops.vercel.app) with friends
- [one tweet](https://x.com/arjuncodess/status/1935660046471360839) crossed 20k views because a hiring manager posted my application

june was chaotic. wins mixed with decisions i didn't fully know how to justify yet.

### July

- runner h challenge results confirmed. won $500

internet validation hit hard this month.
it felt good. maybe too good.

### August

- built [astroscope](https://github.com/ArjunCodess/astroscope)

this was when i started feeling less like a spectator and started building actively.

## Resolutions I Set for 2025 (and How They Went)

at the start of the year, i wrote down a list on [this post](https://arjunwritess.medium.com/dreams-for-25-ab11a9f2fd93).

1. **build many, many projects:** done.
2. **learn system design:** not done. yeah, i'm dumb for this one. deep thinking matters.
3. **solve leetcode regularly:** done.
4. **read at least 5 books:** not done. i miss reading. i kept saying "soon" and never made space for it.
5. **fix my sleep schedule and manage time better:** not done. i just couldn't.
6. **launch two big projects:** done.
7. **write more:** done.
8. **contribute to open source:** done.

no, i didn't complete everything.
but i didn't abandon myself completely either.
5/8 sounds good to me.

## What This Year Really Showed Me

i build fast.
sometimes to avoid sitting still.

i love starting things.
finishing the emotional ones is harder.

i chase clarity through output of my work. and that's not the worst part.
the worst part is that some answers don't come from shipping.
and i'm proved wrong once again.

i also learned that losing people quietly hurts more than public failures.

i also learned that i'm more consistent than i thought.
(which is actually surprising)
that i don't quit easily.
that even when things feel stuck, i keep moving.

failing a subject shook me more than losing competitions.
it forced me to admit i'm not immune to studies.
yeah, it was my ego.

the 964 days part matters too.
because holding on for that long changes you.
and letting go is a different kind of strength.

## Resolutions for 2026

1. earn $5k online
2. cross 40k followers on dev.to
3. ship more side projects, faster
4. launch pilot ops
5. grow pilot ops to at least $1k mrr
6. prep and give the sat. aim for 1500+
7. get a research paper published
8. qualify zco

and of course, learn. live. grow.

## Closing

i'm not done.
not even close.

but i'm clearer in mind than i was a year ago.

this wasn't a perfect year. (ps: well, almost)
it was an honest one.

and that counts.

thanks to the few who were actually there.
see you in 2026.
